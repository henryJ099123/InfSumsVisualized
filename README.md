This is a small matplotlib personal project to depict the geometric sum
$$S(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} z^i$$
for $z\in\mathbb{C}$.
The orange point indicates the input $z$ to $S$ above,
while each point indicates the iterative sum 
(i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ point represents the partial sum $S_n(z)$).

The circle shown is the circle of convergence -- i.e. only $z\in\mathbb{C}$ in the circle
will have a convergent sum.

You can click on the plot to toggle whether or not you want your mouse's coordinates to be $z$.

You can also manually enter the point and adjust the cutoff for number of points shown
(sadly you cannot show infinitely many points).

In the future, I plan to add more equations such as $S$; next plan is the zeta function $\Zeta(z)$.
This project shows off some pretty spirals in the complex plane, so I hope you enjoy!
